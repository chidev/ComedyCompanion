Developed in 100% React Native, "The Comedy Companion" is the world's first productivity tool for Stand-Up Comedians. Manage your jokes, organize them into set lists, and track performances all in one place.

### Upcoming Features (v1.1)

- Cloud Storage for Android Users
- Running rating of Joke performance by swiping left for good, right for bad on a given show
- Customizable Categories

### Currently Available Features (v1.0)

- Track solid bits as well as those you're currently working on
- Associate detailed notes with each bit
- Create set lists with ease, dragging and dropping jokes into place, and track their estimated length
- Track every show you perform, which set list was used, the venue performed at including city and state
- Reorder everything on the fly as well as search for specific keywords in your bits
- Back everything up to your personal iCloud account for security and ease of transferring data between multiple iPhones and iPads

### Instalation Instructions

Installation should be ridiculously simple once you are set up for React Native development ([Getting Started With React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)) . Simply clone the repository into whatever folder you like, go into that folder and type:

```
npm install
```

Once all the packages are done installing you should be able to simply type `react-native-run-ios` or `react-native-run-android` and the app should boot up in a simulator.
